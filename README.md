# Phase Four
## Analysis of adverse event reported data from the Food and Drug Administration

Identification of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during the post-marketing phase is one of the most important goals of drug safety surveillance. Spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) data, which are the mainstay of traditional drug safety surveillance, are used for hypothesis generation and to validate the newer approaches. The publicly available US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data requires substantial curation before they can be used appropriately, and applying different strategies for data cleaning and normalization can have material impact on analysis results.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to identify medical conditions which are risky.

## Data
This data was previously curated from Banda et al.
